Code Design – Rate Limiter. Here is the exact question I received. Problem Title: Rate Limiter Problem Description: Imagine we are building an application that is used by many different customers. We want to avoid one customer being able to overload the system by sending too many requests, so we enforce a per-customer rate limit. The rate limit is defined as: “Each customer can make X requests per Y seconds” Assuming that customer ID is extracted somehow from the request, implement the following function. // Perform rate limiting logic for provided customer ID. Return true if the // request is allowed, and false if it is not. boolean rateLimit(int customerId)

Karat Interview: 1. An image was provided with some conditions. I was asked to make the same template using html css only. 2. Create a paginated list with react. 3. Theory questions on Js, React, Networking. Browser Coding: 1. Fetch data and display task and sub tasks. Sort the task based on status. The solution should be scalable, performant. Components should be re-usable and file structure should be maintainable. 2. Theory questions on react. JS Coding: 1. Fetch the data and cache the result. store data in sucha way that call should not be made again. Question was about feature flags. Fetch the feature flag value, store the result and add subscription method to flag value change. I was asked to use vanilla js to solve. System Design: Design a system for task app. Task can be in-progress, todo or done status. Emplaning everything in detail.
